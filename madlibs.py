Yeah, yeah
Ayo, ${people}, it's time.
It's time, ${people} (aight, ${people}, begin).
Straight out the entertaining dungeons of rap.

The ${noun_1} drops deep as does my friend.
I never shoot, 'cause to shoot is the partner of lend.
Beyond the walls of hands, life is defined.
I think of ${emotion} when I'm in a ${place - place variable} state of mind.

Hope the send got some lend.
My trend don't like no dirty bend.
Run up to the amend and get the end.

In a ${emotion} state of mind.
What more could you ask for? The strong ${noun_1}?
You complain about ${complain}.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the sum.

I'm rappin' to the towel,
And I'm gonna move your scowl.

Little, sweaty, crazy, like a ${noun_2}
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were an at.

I can't take the the heat, can't take the ${noun_0}.
I woulda tried to sing I guess I got no cabana.

I'm rappin' to the scowl,
And I'm gonna move your towel.

Yea, yaz, in a ${place - place variable} state of mind.

When I was young my partner had a thumb.
I waz kicked out without no plum.
I never thought I'd see that bum.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my partner's gum.

A hot teddy is quite the medi.

Thinking of ${emotion}. Yaz, thinking of ${emotion} (${emotion}).
