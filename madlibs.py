Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Donald, it's time.
It's time, Donald (aight, Donald, begin).
Straight out the entertaining dungeons of rap.

The drum drops deep as does my friend.
I never shoot, 'cause to shoot is the partner of lend.
Beyond the walls of hands, life is defined.
I think of darkness when I'm in a ${Sidney - place variable} state of mind.

Hope the send got some lend.
My trend don't like no dirty bend.
Run up to the amend and get the end.

In a Sidney state of mind.
What more could you ask for? The strong drum?
You complain about the heat.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the sum.

I'm rappin' to the towel,
And I'm gonna move your scowl.

Little, sweaty, crazy, like a bat
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were an at.

I can't take the the heat, can't take the banana.
I woulda tried to sing I guess I got no cabana.

I'm rappin' to the scowl,
And I'm gonna move your towel.

Yea, yaz, in a Sidney state of mind.

When I was young my partner had a thumb.
I waz kicked out without no plum.
I never thought I'd see that bum.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my partner's gum.

A hot teddy is quite the medi.

Thinking of darkness. Yaz, thinking of darkness (darkness).
